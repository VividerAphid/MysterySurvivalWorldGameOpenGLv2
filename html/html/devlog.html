        Today I decided to set up this site finally to make sharing the game a bit easier. I'm now working on packaging a JVM up with the game so that I don't have to worry
        about any annoying runtime issues. Well, less of them...
        <br>
        Update: I don't have the faintest idea how Java packaging works, this may take a bit...

        I spent a large part of my day struggling, struggling, hitting my head against as many brick walls I could find, then finally deciding to use 
        OpenJDKPortable.
        <br>
        I also found something called launch4j, which proved to be really nifty once I figured out how to use it. It appears my setup works now, so the real fun can begin!

        I finally fixed the lighting issue with the terrain, turns out everything worked as expected but I had my light source set at a Y level of 0, so it was inside the ground...
        <br>
        As far as bigger things go, I played around with 3rd person cameras and managed to get a crude one working that can follow any entity in the game world. I'm looking into adding actual rotation
        on first person cameras too.
        <br>
        No guarantees, but I might get off on a tangent messing with terrain heightmap generation...
        <br>
        I do also plan on adding a proper control scheme, currently my setup is a cheat in that it has two keys bound to do the same thing.
        <p>
            I ended up getting distracted working on making plain coloured models that I could generate the colour of at launch time, and it took a lot longer than expected.
