        I spent a large part of my day struggling, struggling, hitting my head against as many brick walls I could find, then finally deciding to use 
        OpenJDKPortable.
        <br>
        I also found something called launch4j, which proved to be really nifty once I figured out how to use it. It appears my setup works now, so the real fun can begin!

        Today I decided to set up this site finally to make sharing the game a bit easier. I'm now working on packaging a JVM up with the game so that I don't have to worry
        about any annoying runtime issues. Well, less of them...
        <br>
        Update: I don't have the faintest idea how Java packaging works, this may take a bit...
