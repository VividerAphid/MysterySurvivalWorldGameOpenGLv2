        <h2>April 2, 2021</h2>
        Today I decided to set up this site finally to make sharing the game a bit easier. I'm now working on packaging a JVM up with the game so that I don't have to worry
        about any annoying runtime issues. Well, less of them...
        <br>
        Update: I don't have the faintest idea how Java packaging works, this may take a bit...
    </p>

        <h2>April 3, 2021</h2>
        I spent a large part of my day struggling, struggling, hitting my head against as many brick walls I could find, then finally deciding to use 
        OpenJDKPortable.
        <br>
        I also found something called launch4j, which proved to be really nifty once I figured out how to use it. It appears my setup works now, so the real fun can begin!

        <h2>April 5, 2021</h2>
        I finally fixed the lighting issue with the terrain, turns out everything worked as expected but I had my light source set at a Y level of 0, so it was inside the ground...
        <br>
        As far as bigger things go, I played around with 3rd person cameras and managed to get a crude one working that can follow any entity in the game world. I'm looking into adding actual rotation
        on first person cameras too.
        <br>
        No guarantees, but I might get off on a tangent messing with terrain heightmap generation...
        <br>
        I do also plan on adding a proper control scheme, currently my setup is a cheat in that it has two keys bound to do the same thing.
        <p>
            I ended up getting distracted working on making plain coloured models that I could generate the colour of at launch time, and it took a lot longer than expected.

        I got the moveable camera working with rotation now, simple right click drag.
        <br>
        I'll probably work on terrain generation next.

        So I spent a few days pondering and researching...<br>
        <img src="../res/FirstPerlinShot.PNG" alt="First 'Perlin' results!">
        <br>
        I got a crude ish Perlin noise working, with some basic settings that I'll be adding to eventually. I'll try not to get distracted with that stuff just yet...
        <br>
        In other news, I also finally came up with a potential title idea that actually seems viable.
        "One Small Step", a reference to the moon landing quote from Armstrong, seemed to fit the general nature of the game.
        <br>
        At one point early on when I made the initial heightmap set up, I made some crude trees:
        <br>

        <br>
        I ended up playing around with some various settings until I found something closer to what I imagined. I added a minimum and maximum height value as well to make things
        feel a little less crazy too.

        Oops. It appears I haven't updated here in a while, but I promise I have been hard at work...
        <br>
        I spent a few weeks researching a terrain generation technique called "Marching Cubes", and it bent the holy hell out of my brain.
        <br>
        After about 20 hours of coding it, I finally did get something to appear, and I never thought I would be so irrationally happy to see a triangle come up on a screen.
        <br>
        Behold the glory:
        <br>
        <img src="../res/firstMarchingTriangle.png" alt="Rats! You just have to see this triangle to appreciate it!">
        <br>
        I still have a lot of work to do to actually get this running at an acceptable level for a game, but I'm very happy to have gotten this far. I'll hopefully push a release out soon including this marching cubes business.

        I whacked away at getting the marching cubes process working a little better. In the process of testing, I actually discovered I had introduced some horrible bugs, and spent a while finding some appropriate solutions to them. I'm still not fully happy with them yet.
        <br>
        Once I get the normals working and the lighting doesn't look completely terrible, I'll post some screenshots.
