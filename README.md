# MysterySurvivalWorldGameOpenGLv2
Second attempt at OpenGL

This game is designed at a basic level with exploration and experimentation in mind. Generated entirely from scratch upon world creation, 
the objective of the game is similar to the likeness of Minecraft, but not knowing anything about your environment. Players are taken on
a journey of exploration in an attempt to get by in the world.

Made in Java using LWJGL, and a lot of concepts not quite in my comfort zone.
