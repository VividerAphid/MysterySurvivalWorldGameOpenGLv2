    <h1>Unnamed Survial Game Landing Page</h1>
    <h2>(Hourse Frontier)</h2>

    A small landing page to better show off the project.

    <p>
    For some reason, <i>Hourse Frontier</i> started as a joke, but has stuck around so I'll just be calling it that for now.
    </p>
    <p>
    Probably one of my bigger annoyances with this project so far has been the issue of its title.
    </p>
    <p>
    Anyways, you can download the latest build
    <a href="https://github.com/VividerAphid/MysterySurvivalWorldGameOpenGLv2/releases"> here</a>
    , no guarantees that it's stable. (Look for the <i>ship.zip</i> file)
    </p>
    <p>
        <h3>v0.0.1-alpha</h3>
        <ul style="list-style-type:none">

        Eventually I'll make this page a bit fancier...
