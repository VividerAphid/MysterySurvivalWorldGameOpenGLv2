    <h1>Unnamed Survial Game Landing Page</h1>
    <h2>(Horse Frontier)</h2>

    A small landing page to better show off the project.

    <p>
    For some reason, <i>Horse Frontier</i> started as a joke, but has stuck around so I'll just be calling it that for now.
    </p>
    <p>
    Probably one of my bigger annoyances with this project so far has been the issue of its title.
    </p>
    <p>
    Anyways, you can download the latest build
    <a href="ship/ship.zip"> here</a>
    , no guarantees that it's stable.
    </p>
    <p>
        For further reading, you can check out the devlog
        <a href="html/html/devlog.html"> here</a>
        , and the gitub repo 
        <a href="https://github.com/VividerAphid/MysterySurvivalWorldGameOpenGLv2">here!</a>  
    </p>
    <p>
        Eventually I'll make this page a bit fancier...
