    <h1>Unnamed Survial Game Landing Page</h1>
    <h2>(Hourse Frontier)</h2>

    A small landing page to better show off the project.

    <p>
    For some reason, <i>Hourse Frontier</i> started as a joke, but has stuck around so I'll just be calling it that for now.
    </p>
    <p>
    Probably one of my bigger annoyances with this project so far has been the issue of its title.
    </p>
    <p>
    Anyways, you can download the latest build
    <a href="https://github.com/VividerAphid/MysterySurvivalWorldGameOpenGLv2/releases"> here</a>
    , no guarantees that it's stable. (Look for the <i>ship.zip</i> file)
    </p>
    <p>
        <h3>v0.0.1b-alpha</h3>
        <ul style="list-style-type:none">
            <li>-Third person camera!</li>
            <li>-Less broken lighting!</li>
            <li>-WASD / ,OEA (dvorak), Scroll to zoom in, left click and drag to rotate around, right click and drag to rotate vertically!</li>
        </ul>
        All of this so far is just me playing around with making the engine work. The actual game work will start soon
    </p>

        For further reading, you can check out the devlog
        <a href="html/html/devlog.html"> here</a>
        , and the gitub repo

    <p>
        Eventually I'll make this page a bit fancier...
