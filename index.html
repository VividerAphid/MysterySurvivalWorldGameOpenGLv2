    <h1>One Small Step</h1>
    <h2>(Hourse Frontier)</h2>

    A small landing page to better show off the project.

    <p>
    One Small Step came from the quote from Armstrong during his moon landing, as I felt the nature of the game was much as he had intended his quote to be.
    Initially, I had been thinking of something involving "leap", but then I thought of One Small Step.

        <ul style="list-style-type:none">
            <li>-Played with 'perlin' noise, got things looking decent for now!</li>
            <li>-Added actual terrain collision!</li>
        </ul>
        All of this so far is just me playing around with making the engine work. The actual game work will start soon.
